This repository contains c++ scripts written to implement various methods of estimation, filtering and tracking. 

These methods have applications in many areas, like data analytics, autonomous vehicles, etc. 
Each project in this repository has its own Readme file, explaining the theory behind its implementation and showing results of implementation over some sample data.


Methods implemented till date:

1. [Method of least squares and normal equations](https://github.com/shorane/cpp_tracking_filtering_estimation/tree/master/Least_squares_and_normal_equations)
2. [Non-Linear Regression](https://github.com/shorane/cpp_tracking_filtering_estimation/tree/master/Non_linear_regression)
